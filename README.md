# Wordle Programmed With C

An assignment around [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), the word game that has caught the attention of the world.  Please read the rules for wordle in the app, and try playing a couple of times if you haven't already.

This assignment is not about writing a program to solve the game.  Instead we are going to produce a tree that contains all of the possible paths to a solution given 1) the solution word, and 2) the grid of coloured tiles that will impose constraints on the potential paths, and then print all of the possible paths to a solution.
